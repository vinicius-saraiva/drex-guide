# Real Digital: A Platform for Tokenized Finance

The Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) published a comprehensive study on June 1st, 2023, outlining how Real Digital and tokenized versions of regulated digital currencies can meet the demand for digital liquidity in tokenized finance. The study emphasizes Real Digital's role in providing a secure, regulated environment for new business models and democratizing access to digital economy benefits.

### Benefits of Asset Tokenization

The study identifies several key advantages of tokenization:

- **Enhanced Transaction Efficiency**: Tokenized assets can be easily transferred in decentralized applications and stored in smart contracts
- **Reduced Counterparty Risk**: Through automated and conditional token exchanges
- **Increased Market Liquidity**: By enabling different types of assets to be registered in the same DLT environment

### Current Market Challenges

<details>
<summary>Important Market Risk Considerations</summary>

The paper highlights a critical gap in the current market: the absence of central bank money compatible with DLT operations has led market participants to use privately issued digital currencies (stablecoins) that lack adequate regulation for settling tokenized asset transactions. This exposes these transactions to private risks that could potentially compromise financial stability.
