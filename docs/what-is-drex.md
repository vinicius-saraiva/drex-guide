# What is DREX?

DREX is the **Brazilian Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)**, designed to bring innovation and inclusivity to Brazil's financial ecosystem.

## Understanding the Name

The name **DREX** was carefully developed following the same successful branding approach used for PIX. According to Director Maur√≠cio, a good brand "helps in product recognition and familiarity." The name components represent:

- **D** and **R**: Representing "Digital Real"
- **E**: Standing for "Electronic"
- **X**: Symbolizing modernity, connectivity, and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)

### Visual Identity
The DREX visual concept aligns with BC#'s modernization agenda through:
- Typography and graphic elements that evoke the digital universe
- Two arrows integrated into the "d" symbolizing the Real's evolution into the digital realm
- Color transition from blue to light green representing "completed transaction"
- Modern and strong phonetics for better public recognition

DREX is a flagship project of the Brazilian Central Bank's innovation agenda, known as [Agenda BC#](/docs/category/agenda-bc). This agenda emphasizes modernizing financial systems and promoting economic inclusion.

## The DREX Platform

Unlike traditional currencies, DREX operates on a versatile digital platform where users can hold not only **Digital Real** (commercial bank digital money or tokenized deposits) but also a wide array of tokenized assets, including:

- Government debt securities
- Property titles (e.g., vehicles, real estate)
- Stocks and other securities
- Various digital assets

This broad functionality positions DREX as a transformative tool for digitizing and simplifying asset management.

## How Does It Work?

Accessing DREX requires going through an **authorized financial intermediary**, such as a bank or fintech. These intermediaries act as bridges, converting traditional deposits into the Digital Real. This structure maintains the involvement of regulated institutions while enabling access to cutting-edge digital financial tools.

## What Makes DREX Unique?

DREX stands out because it is based on **commercial bank digital money (tokenized deposits)** rather than being a direct retail CBDC. This model leverages the existing financial ecosystem, fostering collaboration between the central bank, financial institutions, and end-users.
