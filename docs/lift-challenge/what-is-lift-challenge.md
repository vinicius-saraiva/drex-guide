# What is the LIFT Challenge?

The LIFT Challenge Real Digital was a groundbreaking initiative launched by the Central Bank of Brazil (BC) in partnership with Fenasbac. This special edition of the LIFT (Laboratório de Inovações Financeiras e Tecnológicas) program created a collaborative sandbox environment to explore innovative applications of DREX, Brazil's CBDC.

## Challenge Overview

The initiative invited market participants to develop Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) that would demonstrate practical applications and assess the technological feasibility of a CBDC in Brazil's financial ecosystem.

### Focus Areas

The challenge prioritized four key categories for online use cases:

- **Delivery versus Payment (DvP)**
  - Settlement of transactions with digital assets
  - Both native and tokenized asset support

- **Payment versus Payment (PvP)**
  - Focus on currency exchange facilitation
  - Cross-border payment solutions

- **Internet of Things (IoT)**
  - Algorithmic settlement
  - Machine-to-machine transactions

- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**
  - CBDC-based protocols
  - Regulatory compliance integration

### Key Evaluation Criteria

Projects were assessed based on several critical factors:

- Interoperability with existing payment systems
- Scalability for nationwide retail applications
